# Synopsis

MazeOfPower is an Insane reversing challenge. Players will first reverse engineer a Golang binary containing a maze game. They must identify a backdoor built into the game, and abuse it to win on the server.

## Skills Required
    - Basic decompiler use
    - Patching
    - Scripting
## Skills Learned
    - Golang reversing

# Solution

We are given a large Golang binary. Executing it gives us a 'proof of work' command to run (using [redpwn POW](https://github.com/redpwn/pow)).

If we enter the result of running it, we're prompted with this:

```
Can you solve my maze within 20 seconds?
Controls: q/k/j/h/l

                                                                                                                                                                                                            
  SS                                                                                                                                                                                                        
[ ..SNIP... ]
                                EE

```

We can guess that this is some kind of maze with the walls hidden from us. Pressing `k/j/h/l` acts as arrow keys and moves the `SS` accordingly, printing out a new maze each time. We are unable to bruteforce our way through this as we cannot see the walls and have only 20 seconds on the server.

## Analysis

Opening the binary in IDA Free (used for its good support for Golang), we can see that it is luckily unstripped. We'll navigate to `main_main`, the traditional entrypoint for Golang binaries.

```c
  c = github_com_redpwn_pow_GenerateChallenge(0x1388u);
  a.array = (interface_ *)&RTYPE__ptr_pow_Challenge;
  a.len = (int)c;
  v45.data = os_Stdout;
  v49.str = (uint8 *)"proof of work: curl -sSfL https://pwn.red/pow | sh -s %s\nsolution";
  v49.len = 67LL;
  v44.array = (interface_ *)&a;
  v44.len = 1LL;
  v44.cap = 1LL;
  v45.tab = (runtime_itab *)&go_itab__ptr_os_File_comma_io_Writer;
  *(retval_4957E0 *)&v49.str = fmt_Fprintf(v45, v49, v44);
```

This begins by [generating](https://github.com/redpwn/pow/blob/7a27171e4a1aad12e0a2c578a42f673b93dbc4de/pow.go#L59) a challenge of difficulty of 0x1338, then passes it to `fmt.Fprintf` to print it to stdout.

```c
  v35 = go_itab__ptr_os_File_comma_io_Reader;
  v36 = v42;
  v37 = -1LL;
  v38 = -1LL;
  b.buf.array = (uint8 *)v33;
  ((void (__fastcall *)(int *, char *))loc_46B25A)(&b.buf.len, (char *)&v33 + 8);
  v5 = (__int64)v21;
  v26.loc = (time_Location *)bufio__ptr_Reader_ReadString(&b, '\n');
```

We then seem to read a string from stdin, stopping at `\n`.

```c
  v54.str = (uint8 *)v26.loc;
  v54.len = *(_QWORD *)&s[9];
  v58 = github_com_redpwn_pow__ptr_Challenge_Check((github_com_redpwn_pow_Challenge *)c, v54);
  if ( !v58._r1.tab && v58._r0 )
  {
    challengeSol.str = (uint8 *)v26.loc;
    challengeSol.len = *(_QWORD *)&s[9];
    solBytes = runtime_stringtoslicebyte(0LL, challengeSol);
    LODWORD(solBytes.array) = hash_crc32_ChecksumIEEE(solBytes);
    math_rand_Seed(LODWORD(solBytes.array));
```

We then call `Check` using the original challenge and the provided solution. As `check` [returns `bool, error`](https://github.com/redpwn/pow/blob/7a27171e4a1aad12e0a2c578a42f673b93dbc4de/pow.go#L100), we can guess that this is checking that error != nil, and that the boolean value is true. If so, we take the provided solution and pass it to CRC32, using the resulting value to seed the `math.rand` module.

```c
    v6 = 0LL;
    v7 = 0LL;
    v8 = 0LL;
    v9 = 0LL;
    while ( v6 < 25 )
    {
      *(_QWORD *)&s[1] = v6;
      oldCap = v7;
      oldPtr = v8;
      *(_QWORD *)&s[17] = v9;
      v10 = (int *)runtime_makeslice((internal_abi_Type *)&RTYPE_int_0, 50LL, 50LL);
      v9 = *(_QWORD *)&s[17] + 1LL;
      v7 = oldCap;
      if ( oldCap < (unsigned __int64)(*(_QWORD *)&s[17] + 1LL) )
      {
        v41 = v10;
        *(runtime_slice *)(&v7 - 2) = runtime_growslice(
                                        oldPtr,
                                        v9,
                                        oldCap,
                                        1LL,
                                        (internal_abi_Type *)&RTYPE__slice_int_0);
        v8 = v11;
        v10 = v41;
      }
      else
      {
        v8 = oldPtr;
      }
      v12 = v9;
      v8[v12 - 1].len = 50LL;
      v8[v12 - 1].cap = 50LL;
      if ( *(_DWORD *)&runtime_writeBarrier.enabled )
      {
        runtime_gcWriteBarrier2();
        *v13 = v10;
        v13[1] = v8[v9 - 1].array;
      }
      v8[v9 - 1].array = v10;
      v6 = *(_QWORD *)&s[1] + 1LL;
    }
    *(_OWORD *)&maze.Start = v0;
    *(_OWORD *)&maze.Cursor = v0;
    maze.Directions.len = v9;
    maze.Directions.cap = v7;
    maze.Directions.array = v8;
    maze.Height = 25LL;
    maze.Width = 50LL;
```

There's some sort of difficult-to-read loop here. Luckily, Go has included some types in the binary that IDA has imported - we therefore can tell that this is likely generating a maze of 25 rows x 50 columns.

We then set up the start and goal of the maze, and set some parameters.

```c
   maze.Start = (github_com_itchyny_maze_Point *)runtime_newobject((internal_abi_Type *)&RTYPE_maze_Point);
    p_maze_Point = (maze_Point *)runtime_newobject((internal_abi_Type *)&RTYPE_maze_Point);
    p_maze_Point->X = 24LL;
    p_maze_Point->Y = 49LL;
    maze.Goal = (github_com_itchyny_maze_Point *)p_maze_Point;
    maze.Cursor = (github_com_itchyny_maze_Point *)runtime_newobject((internal_abi_Type *)&RTYPE_maze_Point);
    maze.Solved = 0;
    maze.Started = 0;
    maze.Finished = 0;
    maze.Start = (github_com_itchyny_maze_Point *)runtime_newobject((internal_abi_Type *)&RTYPE_maze_Point);
    v15 = (maze_Point *)runtime_newobject((internal_abi_Type *)&RTYPE_maze_Point);
    v15->X = maze.Height - 1;
    v15->Y = maze.Width - 1;
    maze.Goal = (github_com_itchyny_maze_Point *)v15;
    maze.Cursor = maze.Start;
    github_com_itchyny_maze__ptr_Maze_Generate(&maze);
```

We then define the characters used for formatting the maze. This is rather verbose, but in summary - `Wall` and `Path` are spaces, `Start` is `SS`, `End` is `EE` and `Solution`/`Cursor` are `::`.

We then begin a timer:

```c
    start_time.ext = (int64)time_NewTicker(10000000LL);
    v60 = time_Now();
    start_time.wall = v60.wall;
```

The program then prints the 'Can you solve my maze...' message, and drops into a loop to process input.

```c
   while ( 1 )
    {
      do
      {
LABEL_13:
        inp[0] = 0;
        v62.ptr = (uint8_0 *)inp;
        v62.len = 1LL;
        v62.cap = 1LL;
        v62 = (_slice_uint8_0)os__ptr_File_Read(os_Stdin, v62);
      }
      while ( v62.ptr );
      inp_char = inp[0];
      if ( (unsigned __int8)(inp[0] - 65) <= 0x19u )
        inp_char = inp[0] + 32;
      if ( !maze.Finished )
      {
        for ( i = 0LL; i < main_keyDirs.len; ++i )
        {
          v20 = main_keyDirs.array[i];
          if ( v20->char == inp_char )
          {
```

We repeatedly read a single character of user input, The `inp_char` operation here converts it to lowercase if it is an uppercase letter. We then iterate over `main_keyDirs` - an array of pointers to `keyDir` structures, consisting of a `char c` and `long long direction`. If we find an entry with that key...

```c
            github_com_itchyny_maze__ptr_Maze_Move(&maze, v20->dir);
            if ( maze.Finished )
              github_com_itchyny_maze__ptr_Maze_Solve(&maze);
            v19 = github_com_itchyny_maze__ptr_Maze_String(&maze, &format).str;
            *(_OWORD *)&v29.m256_f32[4] = v0;
            v57.len = 61LL;
            v51.len = (int)v19;
            v51.cap = (int)&format;
            v57.str = (uint8 *)&aCanYouSolveMyM;
            v47 = runtime_concatstring2(0LL, v57, *(string *)&v51.len);
            v47.str = (uint8 *)runtime_convTstring(v47);
            *(_QWORD *)&v29.m256_f32[4] = &RTYPE_string_0;
            *(_QWORD *)&v29.m256_f32[6] = v47.str;
            v47.len = (int)os_Stdout;
            v47.str = (uint8 *)&go_itab__ptr_os_File_comma_io_Writer;
            v51.len = 1LL;
            v51.cap = 1LL;
            v51.array = (interface_ *)&v29.m256_f32[4];
            fmt_Fprintln((io_Writer)v47, v51);
            if ( maze.Finished )
            {
              v61.wall = v26.wall;
              v61.ext = (int64)t;
              v61.loc = (time_Location *)a.cap;
              v61.wall = time_Since(v61);
              main_printFinished(&maze, v61.wall);
            }
            goto LABEL_13;
```
We move in that direction, before checking if we're now done.

Below, however, we have some special handling.

```c
     }
      if ( inp_char == 'q' )
        break;
      if ( inp_char == 'b' )
      {
        github_com_itchyny_maze__ptr_Maze_Solve(&maze);
        maze.Finished = 1;
        v48 = github_com_itchyny_maze__ptr_Maze_String(&maze, &format);
        *(_OWORD *)v29.m256_f32 = v0;
        v48.str = (uint8 *)runtime_convTstring(v48);
        *(_QWORD *)v29.m256_f32 = &RTYPE_string_0;
        *(_QWORD *)&v29.m256_f32[2] = v48.str;
        v48.len = (int)os_Stdout;
        v48.str = (uint8 *)&go_itab__ptr_os_File_comma_io_Writer;
        v52.len = 1LL;
        v52.cap = 1LL;
        v52.array = (interface_ *)&v29;
        fmt_Fprintln((io_Writer)v48, v52);
      }
```
If the character is `q`, we break out and quit immediately. If instead it is `b` (an action not listed in the controls), we immediately mark the maze as solved. We then print it out.

If we try running the program now and pressing `b`, the entire maze solution is printed out, with `::` used to represent the path.

## Locating the flag

However, solving the maze like this does not give us the flag immediately. `main_printFinished` opens `flag.txt` and prints it, but only if we arrive there by actually solving the maze. Once we have used `b` to print out the solution for us, we are no longer able to pass inputs.

If we remember earlier, however, the `math.rand` module is seeded with the challenge solution. So given a specific solution, we will always generate the same maze. We can abuse this by:

- Connecting to the server and getting the challenge
- Solving it
- Executing the local binary and input the solution (binary should be patched to accept any challenge solution)
- Using `b` to gather the maze solution
- Executing that solution remotely

We'll start by patching the binary. Navigating to the call to `Check`, there are two checks for the error and the result. We can simply replace
```
test rbx, rbx
jne <fail>
test al, al
je <fail>
```
with the equivalent number of NOPs.

We can verify this by running and entering any solution.

## Parsing the Maze

Lets start by parsing the maze solution and processing it.
We'll write a function that takes a challenge and calculates the steps to solve the corresponding maze.
```py
from pwn import *


def solve_maze_for_challenge(challenge):
    steps = []
    ...
    return steps, solution
```

First, we need to execute the challenge to get the solution, then run the patched binary with it.

```py
    with log.progress("[+] Getting solution...") as p:
        solution = process(challenge, shell=True).read().decode().strip()
        p.success(solution)

    with log.progress("[+] Getting maze path...") as prog:
        p = process("./main.patched")
        p.sendlineafter(b"solution: ", solution)
        p.clean()
        p.sendline(b"b")
        maze = p.clean().decode()
```

We now want to walk through the maze, returning the direction needed to go to each next step. We'll write a generator for this.
First we need to convert the maze to a 2D list (remembering that each 2 characters represents a single 'cell' of the maze), while also finding the starting position. We'll also need to track the previous position so we don't backtrack.

By experimenting with the program, we can identify 2 useful facts:
- Pressing any key moves us *2* cells in that direction
- We start immediately to the right of the 'SS' position, but are covered by the empty 'StartRight' in the maze formatting.

```py
def maze_steps(maze_str):
    maze = []
    last_pos = None
    pos = None
    for i, line in enumerate(maze_str.split("\n")):
        maze_line = []
        for j in range(0, len(line), 2):
            chunk = line[j:j+2]
            if chunk == "SS": pos = pos = (i, j//2 + 1)
            maze_line.append(chunk)
        maze.append(maze_line)
    if pos is None:
        log.critical("start pos not found")
        raise StopIteration
```

We'll then repeatedly look in a circle around our current position, looking for the next `::`.

```py
    seen = set()
    while True:
        if maze[pos[0]][pos[1]] == "EE":
            return
        # Up, Right, Down, Left
        for dy, dx, direction in [
            (-1, 0, 'k'),
            (0, 1, 'l'),
            (1, 0, 'j'),
            (0, -1, 'h'),
        ]:
            new_pos = (pos[0] + dy, pos[1] + dx)
            # Don't go out of bounds
            if new_pos[0] < 0 or new_pos[0] >= len(maze): continue
            if new_pos[1] < 0 or new_pos[1] >= len(maze[new_pos[0]]): continue
            # Don't visit our previous position
            if new_pos in seen: continue
            next_val = maze[new_pos[0]][new_pos[1]]
            if next_val == "::":
                seen.add(pos)
                seen.add(new_pos)
                # Take two steps
                new_pos = (pos[0] + dy * 2, pos[1] + dx * 2)
                pos = new_pos
                yield direction
                break
            elif next_val == "EE":
                pos = new_pos
                yield direction
                break
        else:
            log.critical("could not solve")
            return
```

This will yield each of the steps required in turn; we'll use `steps.extend(maze_steps(maze))` in our first function to use this. We can now put it all together:

```py
r = remote(args.HOST or "127.0.0.1", args.PORT or 1337)
r.recvuntil(b"proof of work: ")
challenge = r.recvline().strip().decode()
steps, solution = solve_maze_for_challenge(challenge)
r.sendlineafter(b"solution: ", solution.encode())
for step in steps:
    r.recvuntil(b'EE').decode()
    r.send(step.encode())
result = r.clean().strip().decode()
print(result)
```

The remote will give us the flag.
