# Synopsis

FollowThePath is a Medium reversing challenge. Players will discover a self-decrypting code stub, before reverse engineering a flag check.

## Skills Required
    - Knowledge of assembly
## Skills Learned
    - Identifying self decompilation

# Solution

We are given a small Windows binary. If we execute it, we are prompted with 'Please enter the flag'. Entering any value prints 'Nope', followed by a crash.

If we open it up in a decompiler, we see some interesting code.

```c
int main() {
    int64_t var_18 = __security_cookie ^ &var_d8
    fputs("Please enter the flag")
    char flag[0x7f]
    fgets(&flag, 0x7f, sub_140003064(0))
    if ((flag[0] ^ 0xc4) != 0x8c) {
        noreturn sub_140001a00() __tailcall
    }
    int64_t i = 0
    do {
        *(&data_140001039 + i) = *(&data_140001039 + i) ^ 0xde
        i = i + 1
    } while (i != 0x39)
    int32_t rflags
    int32_t rbx
    __out_dx_oeax(i.w, rbx, rflags)
    undefined
}
```

After reading in the flag and doing some small checks, the binary does some XORing, followed by executing some strange instructions. The function called if the check doesn't match prints 'Nope' and exits. If we check the expected value of the check:
```py
>>> chr(0x8c ^ 0xc4)
'H'
```
We can assume that this is the start of a flag check. If we go down to the assembly level, and show addresses:
```x86asm
140001000  xor     r8, r8  {0x0}
140001003  mov     r8b, byte [r12+rcx]
140001007  xor     r8, 0xc4
14000100e  cmp     r8, 0x8c
140001015  je      0x14000101e

14000101b  jmp     r10  {fail}
{ Does not return }

14000101e  inc     rcx  {0x1}
140001021  lea     r8, [rel data_140001039]
140001028  xor     rdx, rdx  {0x0}

14000102b  xor     byte [r8+rdx], 0xde
140001030  inc     rdx
140001033  cmp     rdx, 0x39
140001037  jne     0x14000102b

140001039  xchg    ebx, eax  {0x40001a20}
14000103a  out     dx, eax
14000103b  ??
```

We can see that the data being XORed is actually the program's own code, immediately after the 'H' check - the program decrypts itself at runtime.

## Decryption

We'll XOR the next 0x39 bytes with `0xde`, then decompile the result. Before jumping to the self-decryption code, the program loads the 'fail' function into r10, the 'win' function into r11, the flag into r12, and sets rcx to 0, so I will set these arguments accordingly.

```c
int64_t sub_14000103c(void* fail @ r10, void* win @ r11, char* flag @ r12)

int64_t rcx
int64_t r8
r8.b = flag[rcx]
if ((r8 ^ 0x55) != 1) {
❓    jump(fail)
}
int64_t i = 0
do {
    *(&data_140001072 + i) = *(&data_140001072 + i) ^ 0xeb
    i = i + 1
} while (i != 0x39)
```

Once again, we'll confirm the XOR value expected:
```c
>>> chr(0x55 ^ 1)
'T'
```

This checks the second character, before decrypting the next chunk of the snippet. We can assume that the program will keep self decrypting for each chunk, so we will automate decoding the rest.

First, the format of each snippet is:

```x86asm
xor r8, r8
mov r8b, byte [r12 + rcx]
xor r8, <KEY BYTE>
cmp r8, <CHECK BYTE>
je continue
jmp r10; (failure)
continue:
inc rcx
lea r8, [rel next_chunk]
xor rdx, rdx
loop:
xor byte [r8 + rdx], <XOR BYTE>
inc rdx
cmp rdx, 0x39
jne loop
next_chunk: ....
```

## Automating

Let's automatically pull the data from the file. We can first locate the offset of the first checking stub in the file, which is 0x400.

```py
out_bin = 'chall.exe'

with open(out_bin, 'rb') as f:
    f.seek(0x400)
    out_bin_data = f.read()
```

We'll write a function to extract the 'KEY BYTE', 'CHECK BYTE' and 'XOR BYTE' from each chunk, and set up our loop for each chunk.

```py
def process_chunk(chunk):
    k1 = chunk[10]
    k2 = chunk[17]
    k3 = chunk[0x2b + 4]
    return k1, k2, k3

flag = ""
for i in range(0, 0x39 * 100, 0x39):
    if "}" in flag: break
    ...
```

Within the loop, we'll grab each chunk and calculate the flag character from it:

```py
    chunk = out_bin_data[i:i+0x39]
    key, check, xor = process_chunk(chunk)
    flag += chr(key ^ check)
    print(flag)
```

If we now run this, it will grab and decrypt each character.

You may have noticed here that we don't actually use the value of 'XOR' to decrypt the next chunk. This is because of a property of XOR.

For example, the second byte checks `FLAG_CHAR ^ 0x55 == 0x01`. That chunk is XORed with `0xde`, so the bytes become `0xeb` and `0xdf` - which still XOR together to produce `T`. This is because the XOR operation is commutative - like addition, the order of operations doesn't matter, the result is the same.
