# Synopsis

BoxCutter is a Very Easy reversing challenge. Players will use `strace` to identify the flag.

## Skills Learned
    - Use of `strace`

# Solution

If players run the challenge, they will receive the message `[X] Error: Box Not Found`. If we run it under strace, we will see the following:

```
[ .. SNIP .. ]
munmap(0x7f2ee0bd7000, 334763)          = 0
openat(AT_FDCWD, "HTB{...}", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
fstat(1, {st_mode=S_IFCHR|0620, st_rdev=makedev(0x88, 0), ...}) = 0
[ .. SNIP .. ]
```

The binary is trying to open a file with the name of the flag. We have now solved the challenge.
