# Synopsis

LootStash is a Very Easy reversing challenge.

## Skills Learned
    - Using `strings`

# Solution

If we run the binary, it will print a series of dots over 5 seconds, then tell us a weapon that was retrieved from the stash.

```
Diving into the stash - let's see what we can find.
.....
You got: 'Supinity, Ferocity of Bloodlust'. Now run, before anyone tries to steal it!
```

If we run `strings` and `grep` for `HTB`, we can locate the flag in the binary.
