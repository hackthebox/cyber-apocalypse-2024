# Synopsis

- In this challenge the player is provided with a vulnerable version of the RSA cryptosystem. More specifically, the modulus used to encrypt the flag is a prime number instead of being a product of two prime factors $p,q$. This makes computing $φ(n)$ an easy task as $φ(p) = p-1$, when $p$ is prime. From there, we can calculate the private key and decrypt the flag.

## Description

- Surrounded by an untamed forest and the serene waters of the Primus river, your sole objective is surviving for 24 hours. Yet, survival is far from guaranteed as the area is full of Rattlesnakes, Spiders and Alligators and the weather fluctuates unpredictably, shifting from scorching heat to torrential downpours with each passing hour. Threat is compounded by the existence of a virtual circle which shrinks every minute that passes. Anything caught beyond its bounds, is consumed by flames, leaving only ashes in its wake. As the time sleeps away, you need to prioritise your actions secure your surviving tools. Every decision becomes a matter of life and death. Will you focus on securing a shelter to sleep, protect yourself against the dangers of the wilderness, or seek out means of navigating the Primus’ waters?

## Skills Required

- Basic Python source code analysis.
- Basic knowledge of the RSA cryptosystem.
- Know what Euler Totient function $φ(n)$ is and some properties.

## Skills Learned

- Learn how to crack the RSA cryptosystem when the modulus $n$ is prime.

# Enumeration

In this challenge we are provided with two files:

- `source.py` : This is the main script that encrypts the flag with a custom RSA cryptosystem.
- `output.txt` : This file contains the RSA public key and the encrypted flag.

## Analyzing the source code

If we look at the `source.py` script we can see that our goal is to decrypt the flag that is encrypted with a custom RSA cryptosystem. The source code is short which makes the task of understanding the flow of the script a trivial task to do.

```python
import math
from Crypto.Util.number import getPrime, bytes_to_long
from secret import FLAG

m = bytes_to_long(FLAG)

n = math.prod([getPrime(1024) for _ in range(2**0)])
e = 0x10001
c = pow(m, e, n)

with open('output.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write(f'{n = }\n')
    f.write(f'{e = }\n')
    f.write(f'{c = }\n')
```

Knowing that, by design, RSA is secure in the pre-quantum era, we suppose that there is some security hole in the implementation of this RSA cryptosystem which makes decryption computationally feasible. At first glance, we notice that the value of $e$ is the standard choice $65537$​. Moreover, the ciphertext is computed in a standard way so we can rule out the possibility that $e$ and $c$ cause any vulnerability.

This means that we should probably take a look at the modulus $n$​.

Before moving on, let us read the data from the output file using the `exec` built-in function.

```python
with open('output.txt') as f:
    exec(f.read())
```

# Solution

## Finding the vulnerability

We generally know that $n$ should be a product of two primes $p,q$. However, in this challenge, we see that instead of $n$ being a product of $2$ primes, it is a product of $2^0 = 1$ prime which makes $n$ a prime itself. The security of RSA lies in the computational difficulty of solving the integer factorization problem; that is, figuring out the two primes $p,q$ knowing $p*q$. In our case, as $n$ is prime, the two factors are $n$ and $1$ so we can compute $φ(n)$ and eventually the decryption key.

Let us recap what $φ(n)$ is. This is known as the **Euler Totient function** and gives us the number of elements smaller than $n$ that are coprime with $n$.  Normally, if $n = p \cdot q$, then the number of the elements that are coprime with $n$ is computed by:
$$
φ(n) = φ(p \cdot q) = φ(p) \cdot φ(q) = (p-1) \cdot (q-1)
$$
However, since $n$ is prime, every number smaller than $n$ is coprime with $n$ as the only factors are $1$ and itself. Therefore, it can be computed as:
$$
φ(n) = n-1
$$
Once we know $φ(n)$ we can compute the private key normally as:
$$
d \equiv e^{-1} \pmod {φ(n)}\\
d \equiv e^{-1} \pmod {n-1}
$$

## Exploitation

Let us write a simple function that computes the Euler totient function of the prime number $n$.

```python
def compute_euler_phi(n):
		return n-1
```

Then, let us write two functions that computes the private key and decrypt the flag.

```python
from Crypto.Util.number import long_to_bytes

def compute_private_key(n, e, phi):
  	d = pow(e, -1, phi)
    return d

def decrypt_flag(c, d, n):
		m = pow(c, d, n)
    return long_to_bytes(m)
```

### Getting the flag

A final summary of all that was said above:

1. Notice that the script implements a slightly modified version of the RSA cryptosystem.
2. The public exponent $e$ and the ciphertext $c$​ are standard so this is a sign that the vulnerability lies on the modulus generation.
3. From the source code we can see that $n$ is the product of a single prime and not of two primes $p, q$ as it normally should. This means that $n$ is a prime number.
4. This makes it easy to compute $φ(n) = n-1$.
5. Finally we can compute the private key $d$ and decrypt the flag.

This recap can be represented by code with the `pwn()` function:

```python
def pwn():
		with open('output.txt') as f:
    		exec(f.read())
		phi = compute_euler_phi(n)
    d = compute_private_key(n, e, phi)
    flag = decrypt_flag(c, d, n)
    print(flag.decode())

if __name__ == '__main__':
  	pwn()
```
