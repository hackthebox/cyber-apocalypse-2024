# Synopsis

- The task in this challenge is to identify the substitution cipher and reverse the encryption process by shifting the alphabet to the right. From the flag, the player can learn that this cipher is also known as the Trithemius cipher.

## Description

- You find yourself trapped inside a sealed gas chamber, and suddenly, the air is pierced by the sound of a distorted voice played through a pre-recorded tape. Through this eerie transmission, you discover that within the next 15 minutes, this very chamber will be inundated with lethal hydrogen cyanide. As the tapeâ€™s message concludes, a sudden mechanical whirring fills the chamber, followed by the ominous ticking of a clock. You realise that each beat is one step closer to death. Darkness envelops you, your right hand restrained by handcuffs, and the exit door is locked. Your situation deteriorates as you realise that both the door and the handcuffs demand the same passcode to unlock. Panic is a luxury you cannot afford; swift action is imperative. As you explore your surroundings, your trembling fingers encounter a torch. Instantly, upon flipping the switch, the chamber is bathed in a dim glow, unveiling cryptic letters etched into the walls and a disturbing image of a Roman emperor drawn in blood. Decrypting the letters will provide you the key required to unlock the locks. Use the torch wisely as its battery is almost drained out!


## Skills Required

- Elementary python source code analysis.
- Basic knowledge of substitution ciphers.
- Optionally know how Caesar cipher works.

## Skills Learned

- Learn about Trithemius cipher.
- Get introduced to classical cryptography by decrypting substitution cipheres with known key.

# Enumeration

In this challenge, we are given two files:

- `source.py` : This is the main script that encrypts the flag.
- `output.txt` : This file contains the encrypted flag.

## Analyzing the source code

If we look at the `source.py` script we can see that it is clear what we have to do. We are given the encrypted flag and the goal is to decrypt it.

First of all, let us take a look at the encryption algorithm.

```python
def encrypt(m):
    c = ''
    for i in range(len(m)):
        ch = m[i]
        if not ch.isalpha():
            ech = ch
        else:
            chi = to_identity_map(ch)
            ech = from_identity_map(chi + i)
        c += ech
    return c
```

The flow of the function can be described as follows:

1. It iterates through the flag characters.
2. If the current character, say $ch$, is not alphabetical, or in other words, is not included in the alphabet `ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`, it is appended to ciphertext without being encrypted at all.
3. If $c$ is alphabetic, it is first converted based on the table $[A=0, B=1, C=2, ..., Z=25]$. That is, if $ch = 0x45 = \ 'E'$, then this is mapped to the value $0x45 - 0x41 = 4$ inside the range $[0, 25]$.
4. Finally, the ciphertext character is determined by shifting the alphabet to the left by $i$ positions. That is, the first time it is shifted by $0$, then by $1$, then $2$ and so on. For example, when $i = 4$ and $ch =0x44 = \ 'D'$, the mapped character is $0x44 - 0x41 = 3$. Then, the encrypted character is $ech = 3 + 4 = 7$. Looking at the conversion table (that starts from index 0), this maps back to the letter $'H'$.

There are two functions in the script responsible for converting to the identity map back and forth.

```python
def to_identity_map(a):
    return ord(a) - 0x41

def from_identity_map(a):
    return chr(a % 26 + 0x41)
```

If we ignore the fact that the shift is iteratively increased by 1 for each letter and is not static, the cipher is identical to a Caesar cipher.

# Solution

## Finding the vulnerability

The vulnerability of the cipher in the challenge is the same as in most mono-alphabetic substitution ciphers; that is, the keyspace is very small which makes bruteforcing the key feasible. However, in this challenge there is no need to worry about determining the key shift as it is already known. The first letter is shifted to the **left** by 1, the second letter by 2 and so on. Therefore, all we have to do is shift the encrypted letters to the **right** by the same shift number.

Before moving on, let us write a function to load the encrypted flag from `output.txt`:

```python
def load_data(filename):
    with open('output.txt') as f:
        f.readline()
        enc = f.readline()
		return enc
```

Having explained the above, the decrypt function seems like a trivial thing to implement. All we have to do is rewrite the encryption function and change $ch + i$ to $ch - i$ and of course adjust the variable names accordingly. By changing the sign we change the shift direction of the alphabet.

## Exploitation

The decrypt function can be implemented as follows:

```python
def decrypt(enc):
    flag = ''
    for i in range(len(enc)):
        ech = enc[i]
        if not ech.isalpha():
            m = ech
        else:
            echi = to_identity_map(ech)
            m = from_identity_map(echi - i)
        flag += m
		return flag
```

### Getting the flag

A final summary of all that was said above:

1. Notice that the cipher in the challenge is a substitution cipher.
2. This cipher is very similar to a Caesar cipher but the shift key is iteratively incremented by 1 for each letter.
3. The key space is small so all we have to do is shift the alphabet to the right by the same shift number.

This recap can be represented by code with the `pwn()` function:

```python
def pwn():
		enc = load_data('output.txt')
    flag = decrypt(enc)
    print(f'HTB{{{flag}}}')

if __name__ == '__main__':
		pwn()
```
