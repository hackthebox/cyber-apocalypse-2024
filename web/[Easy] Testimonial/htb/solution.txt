This challenge uses Golang + Templ, which is a new-ish templating language in Golang. It uses AIR, which monitors the golang files and will update the website upon modification.

The idea of the challenge is just a basic microservice challenge. There is a Website and "File Writer" service (GRPC). The website has sanitizations in place around the filename, but if you access the File Writer service directly there is no sanitization. It is probably possible to use GRPCurl to make this request, but since you need to replace an entire file it can be hard to do all the escapes properly. It is far easier to just write a golang program to send the malicious file.
