# Synopsis

A very easy simple challenge around SSH logs and Bash history

## Description

* As the preparations come to an end, and The Fray draws near each day, our newly established team has started work on refactoring the new CMS application for the competition. However, after some time we noticed that a lot of our work mysteriously has been disappearing! We managed to extract the SSH Logs and the Bash History from our dev server in question. The faction that manages to uncover the perpetrator will have a massive bonus come the competition! Note: Operating Hours of Korp: 0900 - 1900

## Skills Required

* Linux basics

## Skills Learned

* SSH Logs
* Bash History

## Q1: "What is the IP Address and Port of the SSH Server (IP:PORT)"

## A1: 100.107.36.130:2221

From the SSH logs, we find any line that refers to an inbound connection: `Connection from 101.111.18.92 port 44711 on 100.107.36.130 port 2221`

## Q2: "What time is the first successful Login"

## A2: 2024-02-13 11:29:50

```txt
[2024-02-13 11:29:50] Accepted password for root from 100.81.51.199 port 63172 ssh2
[2024-02-13 11:29:50] Starting session: shell on pts/2 for root from 100.81.51.199 port 63172 id 0
```

## Q3: "What is the time of the unusual Login"

## A3: 2024-02-19 04:00:14

We know the Korp's hours of operation are from 0900 - 1900 so an SSH login at 0400 in the morning is suspicious

```txt
[2024-02-19 04:00:14] Starting session: shell on pts/2 for root from 2.67.182.119 port 60071 id 0
```

## Q4: "What is the Fingerprint of the attacker's public key"

## A4: OPkBSs6okUKraq8pYo4XwwBg55QSo210F09FCe1-yj4

Taken from the logs: `ECDSA SHA256:OPkBSs6okUKraq8pYo4XwwBg55QSo210F09FCe1`

## Q5: "What is the first command the attacker executed after logging in"

## A5: whoami

From the bash history file: `[2024-02-19 04:00:18] whoami`

## Q6: "What is the final command the attacker executed before logging out"

## A6: ./setup

From the bash history file: `[2024-02-19 04:14:02] ./setup`
