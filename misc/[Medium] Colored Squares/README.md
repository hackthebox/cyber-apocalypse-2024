# Synopsis

- The goal of this challenge is to understand how the provided [Folders](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Folders) program works by viewing an equivalent transpiled Python or C# version. Then the player should extract the conditions that the input must satisfy and use the z3 solver or some other tool to find the correct input which is the flag itself.

## Description

- In the heart of an ancient forest stands a coloured towering tree, its branches adorned with countless doors. Each door, when opened, reveals a labyrinth of branching paths, leading to more doors beyond. As you venture deeper into the maze, the forest seems to come alive with whispered secrets and shifting shadows. With each door opened, the maze expands, presenting new choices and challenges at every turn. Can you understand what's going on and get out of this maze?

## Skills Required

- Basic knowledge of esoteric programming languages (esolangs).
- Know how to research about odd programming languages.
- Know how to use the z3 solver.

## Skills Learned

- Become familiar with solving SAT problems with z3 or any other tool.
- Learn about the `Folders` esolang.

# Enumeration

## Analyzing the invisible source code

After unzipping the downloadable, we are welcomed with almost ~3000 folders, some of them nested and some empty. What is surprising is that all of these folders do not contain any standard file that is usually provided in challenges, such as a python script, a C binary, a memory dump etc. It is just a huge structure of folders. We can run the tree command and take a glance at the directories.

We can spend some time inspecting the directories but no clear pattern stands out. Usually, when we are provided with a lot of directories, tools such as `find` and/or `grep` are very handy but since the only files that exist are folders, they are not of much use. At this point, the only tool we possess is the internet.

# Solution

The difficulty in this challenge is to find the correct keywords to research the internet and find out what is going on. In fact, the name of the root folder `src` is a hint itself as this is the default name of folders that contain source code of programming languages. Therefore let us research something like `folder structure programming language code`. Quickly, we stumble upon some results related to an esoteric programming language known as `Folders`. From [this](https://danieltemkin.com/Esolangs/Folders/) blog post we see that it perfectly fits to our case. This is an esolang that encodes the program entirely into the folder structure.

To avoid conflicts with how folders are sorted, it is important to note that the folders' names contain the substring  `New folder ...` which is the default name that the Windows OS gives to newly created folders. Another hint is the challenge name itself; Microsoft's logo consists of four *colored squares*.

The challenge is marked as `Medium` so we assume that we do not have to write our own interpreter to understand what the source code is doing. After a little more research, we find [this](https://github.com/SinaKhalili/Folders.py) repository which is a Python interpreter for the Folders language. Thankfully, this interpreter includes a Python transpiler too that can convert the Folders code to readable Python code.

According to the interpreter's [code](https://github.com/SinaKhalili/Folders.py/blob/main/folders/folders.py#L482) we see that we can run the script with the `-l` argument to view the transpiled Python code. Doing so, we see the following output.

```python
print("Enter the flag in decimal (one character per line) :\n", end='', flush=True)
var_0 = input()
if var_0.isdigit():
    var_0 = int(var_0)
else:
    var_0 = var_0
var_1 = input()
if var_1.isdigit():
    var_1 = int(var_1)
else:
    var_1 = var_1
var_2 = input()
if var_2.isdigit():
    var_2 = int(var_2)
else:
    var_2 = var_2
var_3 = input()
if var_3.isdigit():
    var_3 = int(var_3)
else:
    var_3 = var_3
var_4 = input()
if var_4.isdigit():
    var_4 = int(var_4)
else:
    var_4 = var_4
var_5 = input()
if var_5.isdigit():
    var_5 = int(var_5)
else:
    var_5 = var_5

... REDACTED FOR BREVITY ...

var_21 = input()
if var_21.isdigit():
    var_21 = int(var_21)
else:
    var_21 = var_21

if (((var_7) - (var_18)) == ((var_8) - (var_9))):
    if (((var_6) + (var_10)) == (((var_16) + (var_20)) + (12))):
        if (((var_8) * (var_14)) == (((var_13) * (var_18)) * (2))):
            if ((var_19) == (var_6)):
                if (((var_9) + (1)) == ((var_17) - (1))):
                    if (((var_11) / ((var_5) + (7))) == (2)):
                        if (((var_5) + ((var_2) / (2))) == (var_1)):
                            if (((var_16) - (9)) == ((var_13) + (4))):
                                if (((var_12) / (3)) == (17)):
                                    if ((((var_4) - (var_5)) + (var_12)) == ((var_14) + (20))):
                                        if ((((var_12) * (var_15)) / (var_14)) == (24)):
                                            if ((var_18) == ((173) - (var_4))):
                                                if ((var_6) == ((63) + (var_5))):
                                                    if (((32) * (var_16)) == ((var_7) * (var_0))):
                                                        if ((125) == (var_21)):
                                                            if (((var_3) - (var_2)) == (57)):
                                                                if (((var_17) - (var_15)) == ((var_18) + (1))):
                                                                    print("Good job! :)", end='', flush=True)
```

Creating the encoded Folders program is much more tricky to read and understand than the simplified Python version.

The challenge asks for 22 inputs, where each one corresponds to a character of the flag in its decimal form. After that, there are several conditions that are checked and if all of them are satisfied, a `Good job` message is outputted on the screen which probably indicates that we found the correct flag.

## Setting up z3

One, could either extract these conditions and start solving for the unknown variables with some bruteforce. However, there is a tool that can automate this process known as `z3` which is a SAT problem solver. Therefore, let us create a python script that adds these conditions to z3 and prints out the solution which hopefully should be the flag.

```python
from z3 import *

def get_flag():
    flag = BitVecs('v0, v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6, v7, v8, v9, v10, v11, v12, v13, v14, v15, v16, v17, v18, v19, v20, v21', 8)

    s = Solver()

    s.add(flag[7] - flag[18] == flag[8] - flag[9])
    s.add(flag[6] + flag[10] == flag[16] + flag[20] + 12)
    s.add(flag[8] * flag[14] == 2 * flag[18] * flag[13])
    s.add(flag[19] == flag[6])
    s.add(flag[9] + 1 == flag[17] - 1)
    s.add(flag[11] == 2 * (flag[5] + 7))
    s.add(flag[5] + flag[2]/2 == flag[1])
    s.add(flag[16] - 9 == flag[13] + 4)
    s.add(flag[12] == 17 * 3)
    s.add(flag[4] - flag[5] + flag[12] == flag[14] + 20)
    s.add(flag[12] * flag[15] == 24 * flag[14])
    s.add(flag[18] + flag[4] == 173)
    s.add(flag[6] == flag[5] + 63)
    s.add(flag[16] * 32 == flag[0] * flag[7])
    s.add(flag[21] == 125)
    s.add(flag[3] - flag[2] == 57)
    s.add(flag[17] - flag[15] == flag[18] + 1)

    f = ''
    if s.check() == sat:
        m = s.model()
        for v in flag:
            f += chr(m[v].as_long())
    else:
        print('fail')
    
    return f

print(get_flag())
```

Notice how we converted the division operations to multiplications as z3 does not always work well with division due to floating point issues. By running this script we get the following output:

```
D9D£ú¼3
           [X-
```

Unfortunately, this clearly does not look like the flag. This usually happens when the constraints for z3 are not enough compared to the number of unknowns that exist. Therefore we should add more constraints. We know that the flag consists of alphanumeric bytes and probably special symbols and we also know that the flag has a specific format; namely `HTB{...}`. So we update the z3 solver and see what happens.

```python
for i in range(len(flag)):
    s.add(flag[i] >= 48)
    s.add(flag[i] <= 125)

s.add(flag[0] == ord('H'))
s.add(flag[1] == ord('T'))
s.add(flag[2] == ord('B'))
s.add(flag[3] == ord('{'))
s.add(flag[21] == ord('}'))
```

The condition `flag[i] >= 48` came up after some failed tests with `flag[i] >= 32` or `flag[i] >= 35`. By running the script again we get a string way closer to the flag as some words already stand out, like `f0ld3rs`. Let us add a *guess* condition that the character before `}` is `s` so that the word `f0ld3rs` is constructed.

```python
s.add(flag[20] == ord('s'))
```

## Exploitation

By running the final version of the python script, we are happy to see the flag printed on our screen.

### Getting the flag

A final summary of all that was said above:

1. Notice the hints being provided such as the root folder's name `src` and the challenge name to identify that the provided zip contains an implementation of the Folders esoteric programming language.
2. Find out a Folders interpreter and dump the transpiled Python code to understand what the program is doing.
3. Extract the conditions from the code and use z3 to solve the SAT problem and get the flag.

This recap can be represented by code with the `pwn()` function:

```python
def pwn():
  	flag = get_flag()
    print(flag)
    
if __name__ == '__main__':
  	pwn()
```
