## Challenge

We're greeted with a socket server waiting for our answer on a riddle. If we check the `riddler.riddler.py` code we can see that we construct a Python function using the `FunctionType` which is called `_answer_func`. As an argument `FunctionType` gets a `Code` object which basically represents [_byte-compiled executable Python code_](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#code-objects).  After we construct `_answer_func` we check if it's results are the same with `(min(num_list),max(num_list))`. So we basically want to construct a function that returns a tuple with the min and max of an array. 

We can see that this object has already most attributes already there. The most importants are the:

- `codeobject.co_consts`
- `codeobject.co_varnames`
- `codeobject.co_code`

`co_consts` is a tuple containing the literals used by the bytecode in the function. In this case the tuple is: `(None, self.max_int, self.min_int)`

`co_varnames` is a tuple containing the names of the local variables in the function (starting with the parameter names). In this case the tuple is: `("num_list", "min", "max", "num")`

The one that we need to complete is the `co_code` which is a bytestring representing the sequence of bytecode instructions in the function. We can see that we already have the start and the end of this function. Let's see what it does...

```console
    (Pdb) dis.dis(_answer_func)
          0 LOAD_CONST               1 (1000)
          2 STORE_FAST               1 (min)
          4 LOAD_CONST               2 (-1000)
          6 STORE_FAST               2 (max)
          8 LOAD_FAST                1 (min)
         10 LOAD_FAST                2 (max)
         12 BUILD_TUPLE              2
         14 RETURN_VALUE
```

We can see that the function stores 1000 in the `min` var and -1000 in the `max` var. After that it returns a tuple of the form `(min, max)`. We can also see that the parameter name `num_list` is loaded in the function. So we can recontruct the function as:
```python
def _answer_func(num_list: list[int]):
    min: int = 1000
    max: int = -1000
    # missing code
    return (min,max)
```
In between our "answer" is loaded which is the remaining missing bytecode sequence. We can either construct from the start using Python's [opcodes](https://unpyc.sourceforge.net/Opcodes.html), or we can write the function, dissassemble it and get the part that we need.
```console
>>> def _answer_func(num_list: int):
...     min: int = 1000
...     max: int = -1000
...     for num in num_list:
...             if num < min:
...                     min = num
...             if num > max:
...                     max = num
...     return (min, max)
... 
>>> _answer_func.__code__.co_code
b'\x97\x00d\x01}\x01d\x02}\x02|\x00D\x00]\x12}\x03|\x03|\x01k\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00r\x02|\x03}\x01|\x03|\x02k\x04\x00\x00\x00\x00r\x02|\x03}\x02\x8c\x13|\x01|\x02f\x02S\x00'
```
Last thing would be to return a list of the bytes of the sub-bytestring:
```console
>>> [b for b in b'|\x00D\x00]\x12}\x03|\x03|\x01k\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00r\x02|\x03}\x01|\x03|\x02k\x04\x00\x00\x00\x00r\x02|\x03}\x02\x8c\x13']
[124, 0, 68, 0, 93, 18, 125, 3, 124, 3, 124, 1, 107, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 114, 2, 124, 3, 125, 1, 124, 3, 124, 2, 107, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 114, 2, 124, 3, 125, 2, 140, 19]
````
When we send the bytes (without the []) we'll get the flag:

```console
➜  htb nc 127.0.0.1 1337

___________________________________________________________

While journeying through a dense thick forest, you find    

yourself reaching a clearing. There an imposing obsidian   

cube, marked with a radiant green question mark,halts your 

progress,inviting curiosity and sparking a sense of wonder.

___________________________________________________________

> 1. Approach the cube...

> 2. Run away!

(Choose wisely) > 1

___________________________________________________________

As you approach the cube, its inert form suddenly comes to 

life. It's obsidian parts start spinning with an otherwordly

hum, and a distorted voice emanates from withing, posing a 

cryptic question that reverbates through the clearing,     

, shrouded in mystery and anticipation.

> Riddler: 'In arrays deep, where numbers sprawl,
        I lurk unseen, both short and tall.
        Seek me out, in ranks I stand,
        The lowest low, the highest grand.
        
        What am i?'
        
(Answer wisely) > 124, 0, 68, 0, 93, 18, 125, 3, 124, 3, 124, 1, 107, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 114, 2, 124, 3, 125, 1, 124, 3, 124, 2, 107, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 114, 2, 124, 3, 125, 2, 140, 19

Upon answering the cube's riddle, its parts spin in a      

dazzling display of lights. A resonant voice echoes through

the woods that says... HTB{r1ddle_m3_th1s_r1ddle_m3_th4t}

### Implementation

```python
import telnetlib
import re

_payload = b'|\x00D\x00]\x12}\x03|\x03|\x01k\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00r\x02|\x03}\x01|\x03|\x02k\x04\x00\x00\x00\x00r\x02|\x03}\x02\x8c\x13'
_payload_string = ','.join(str(b) for b in _payload)
HOST = "127.0.0.1"
PORT = 1337

tn = telnetlib.Telnet(HOST, PORT)

print(" > Connected succesfully to server...")
tn.read_until(b"\n(Choose wisely) > ")
print(" > Read garbage...")
tn.write(b'1')
tn.read_until(b"\n(Answer wisely) > ")
print(" > Read some more garbage...")
tn.write(_payload_string.encode())
last_message = str(tn.read_all())


pattern = re.compile("HTB\{.*?\}")
match = re.search(pattern, last_message)
print(f" > Found the flag: {match.group()}")
```

### Proof of Concept

```console
htb python solver.py
 > Connected succesfully to server...
 > Read garbage...
 > Read some more garbage...
 > Found the flag: HTB{r1ddle_m3_th1s_r1ddle_m3_th4t}
```
