# Synopsis

Character is a Very Easy misc coding challenge where the remote server prompts you repeatedly for an index of the flag, and when you enter an index it will return the character at that index.

## Description

Security through Induced Boredom is a personal favourite approach of mine. Not as exciting as something like The Fray, but I love making it as tedious as possible to see my secrets, so you can only get one character at a time!

## Skills Required
 - Basic programming skills

## Skills Learned
 - Scripting remote connections

# Enumeration

Connecting to the server gives us this prompt:

```sh
$ nc <ip> <port>
Which character of the flag do you want? Enter an index: 
```

If we input `0`, `1`, etc consecutively, we can see what's happening:

```
Which character of the flag do you want? Enter an index: 0
Character at Index 0: H
Which character of the flag do you want? Enter an index: 1
Character at Index 1: T
Which character of the flag do you want? Enter an index: 2
Character at Index 2: B
```

The first three characters are `HTB`. This is clearly leaking the flag!

# Solution

To solve the challenge, we simply have to start at index `0` and increment it, querying the server for every index. We can script this using pwntools. First start a connection:

```python
from pwn import *

p = remote('<IP>', <PORT>)
```

Then we want to create an empty `flag` string to add onto, and an index counter `idx` that starts at `0`:

```python
flag = ''
idx = 0
```

Now we'll start an infinite loop, incrementing the index we ask for by `1` every time to grab every index. If the character we get is `}`, we know we've reached the end of the flag.

```python
while True:
    p.sendlineafter(b'index: ', str(idx).encode())
    p.recvuntil(b': ')
    char = p.recvS(1)

    flag += char
    idx += 1

    if char == '}':
        break

print(flag)
```

We get the flag!
