# [__Quantum Conundrum 🛰️__](#)

## Description:

KORP™, the heartless corporation orchestrating our battles in The Fray, has pushed us to our limits. Refusing to be a pawn in their twisted game, I've learned of a factionless rebel alliance plotting to dismantle KORP™. While it may sound like mere whispers, there's a chance it holds truth. Rumors suggest they've concealed a vital communication system within The Fray, powered by cutting-edge quantum computing technology. Unfortunately, this system is reportedly malfunctioning.
If I can restore this communication network, it could be the key to toppling KORP™ once and for all. However, my knowledge of quantum computing is limited. This is where you come in! As I infiltrate The Fray to access the system, I'll rely on your expertise to identify and repair the issue. Are you up for the challenge? Together, we can make a difference in this battle against oppression.

## Challenge

We connect to the socket server and we see that we're greeted with a message that says that the server is waiting for our input. We look at the source code where we can see that the server initializes a `CommunicationSystem` class. Digging deeper we see that the `CommunicationSystem` class is basically a qiskit quantum circuit with 3 `quantum registers` and 2 `classical registers`. Let's name the quantum registers as `q0, q1, q2` and the classical registers `c0, c1`. During the initialization of the class the `q0` is given a random `quantum state`. Then it adds the instructions of the input (basically appending quantum gates to the circuit), measuring `q0, q1` by putting their states in the classical registers `c0, c1` and lastly uses a `decode` function. After all that the `test_output` function is called where we get the `state_vector` of the circuit's expirement. The `test_output` function checks if the resulting vector is the same as the `q0` initialized quantum state.
```python
out_vector = [element for element in out_vector if element != 0]
self._information = list(self._information.round(decimals=6))
``` 
If we go back to the `server.py` file we can see that the `CommunicationSystem` class is initalized and tested 100 times and it returns the flag only if all 100 times return `True`.

By researching a little bit we can see that what we actually want is a quantum circuit able to transmit the quantum state of `q0` to another quantum register.

Since in quantum mechanics it's impossible to clone an unknown quantum state of qubit to another qubit (no-cloning theorem), we can use the `quantum teleportation protocol` to transfer the state `|psi>` of qubit `q0` to another qubit, `q2` in this case, by using an entagled pair of qubits (Bell pair).

So what we have to do in this challenge is to complete the quantum circuit to implement the quantum teleportation protocol.

#### Quantum teleportation protocol

To transfer a quantum bit, Alice and Bob must use a third party (Telamon) to send them an entangled qubit pair. Alice then performs some operations on her qubit, sends the results to Bob over a classical communication channel, and Bob then performs some operations on his end to receive Alice’s qubit.

![Alt text](/assets/image.png)

The steps of doing that are:

1. A third party, Telamon, creates an entangled pair of qubits and gives one to Bob and one to Alice.
The pair Telamon creates is a special pair called a Bell pair. In quantum circuit language, the way to create a Bell pair between two qubits is to first transfer one of them to the X-basis using a Hadamard gate, and then to apply a CNOT gate onto the other qubit controlled by the one in the X-basis.
2. Alice applies a CNOT gate to q1, controlled by |psi> (the qubit she is trying to send Bob). Then Alice applies a Hadamard gate to |psi>. In our quantum circuit, the qubit |psi> Alice is trying to send is q0
3. Next, Alice applies a measurement to both qubits that she owns, q1 and |psi>, and stores this result in two classical bits. She then sends these two bits to Bob.
4. Bob, who already has the qubit q2, then applies a decoding function on the state of the classical bits.

In our circuit we can see that step 3 and step 4 are already implemented, so we need to complete step 1 and step 2.

So we basically need to add:
 - Hadamard gate to q1 
 - CNOT gate to q2 controlled by q1
 - CNOT gate to q1 controlled by q0
 - Hadamard gate to q0

 By looking at the code we can see that the server takes instrucions that translates them into gates as such:

```
    {"type": [cnot | hadamard], "register_indexes": [indexes of q registers to apply the gate]};{"type": [], "register_indexes": []}
```

So the input string should be:
```
{"type": "hadamard","register_indexes": [1]};{"type": "cnot","register_indexes": [1,2]};{"type": "cnot","register_indexes": [0, 1]};{"type": "hadamard","register_indexes": [0]}
```

By giving this string as an input to the server we get the flag!

### Implementation

```python
import telnetlib

input = """
        {"type": "hadamard","register_indexes": [1]};{"type": "cnot","register_indexes": [1,2]};{"type": "cnot","register_indexes": [0, 1]};{"type": "hadamard","register_indexes": [0]}
    """
HOST = "127.0.0.1"
PORT = 1337

tn = telnetlib.Telnet(HOST, PORT)

print(" > Connected succesfully to server...")
tn.read_until(b"\n>")
print(" > Read garbage...")
tn.write(input.encode())
print(f" > Sent input: {input}")
tn.read_until((b"\n % Testing quantum circuit, please wait...\n"))
print(" > Read some more garbage...")
flag = tn.read_all()
print(f"> Got flag: {flag.decode()}")
```
